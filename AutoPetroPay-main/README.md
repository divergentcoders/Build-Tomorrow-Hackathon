 Automatic Petrol Paying System
Tech stack used:- BOOTSTRAP AND CSS. Aim:- We at Auto Petro Pay (APP) gives you an application in which you can set the queue for upcoming fuel fillings. The application will develop a QR code. You can either paste this QR code on vehicle or show it from your phone. The person at the pump will scan that code. The amount will automatically be transmitted to the petrol dispenser machine(a chip containing Auto Petro Pay (APP) code will be placed inside the machine) and the amount will be deducted from your wallet.
